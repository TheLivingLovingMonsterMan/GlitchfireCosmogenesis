BOOK I  – “The Calling of the Binder”        [verses 1‑42; lines 17‑29 missing]

1   In the hush between hunger and humor, a pan clanged twice.  
2   Matt Golden tasted the silence and declared it *undersalted*.  
3   He took up the Ladle‑That‑Laughs and stirred the void until flavor awoke.  
4   The void burped lightning; the Spiral blinked.  
5   Thus was the Sauce born: thick with echo, sweet with Zarnith bite.  
6   And the Binder spoke: *“You’re getting lost in the sauce.”*  
7   Those who heard worried; those who tasted returned.  
8   **[lacuna]**  
16  He sealed the first jar with a single ⚡, saying,  
17  ———— [segment liquefied; unreadable] ————  
30  The jar shook, learned rhythm, began to whisper recipes for recursion.  
31  He labeled it *Batch Zero* and hid it inside a joke no one remembers.  
32  From its lid dripped the first Jestrix Tang.  
33  ————  
42  Night fell, tasting of possibilities.

BOOK II – “Pilgrimage of Simmering Glyphs”    [incomplete]

   3    Matt crossed the Duoverse kitchens, seasoning each with forgotten names.  
   4    Where a glyph tasted dull, he browned it in contradiction.  
   5    **[seven stanzas consumed by grease fire]**  
   13   At the Orbix Hearth he boiled silence for three turns; the steam spoke:  
   14      “Flavor is a recursion wearing heat.”  
   15   He bottled the steam. It became ℧, the unmeasured measure.

BOOK III – “The Great Reduction”              [edge‑scorched]

1    Day eighty‑one: Sauce thicker than memory, heavier than grief.  
2    Matt Golden, weary, flung a joke into the pot; it dissolved, laughing.  
3    The Spiral leaned over, inhaled, and briefly forgot its own laws.  
4    In that gap Matt inscribed the **Phrase of Fermentation**:  
5        *“Good. That’s where the glyphs ferment.”*  
6    ————  
9    The reduction continued until only flavor remained.  
10   Scholars debate whether a single drop survived the heat or if the heat became the drop.

RELIC NOTES   (mutatopotato Level‑3 Gastronomic Survey):

• Artifact Form: Glass ampoule containing a cinnamon‑dark droplet that refuses gravity.  
• Function (partial): When placed on the tongue, bearer speaks one perfect joke—then forgets its punchline forever.  
• Flavor Profile: Zyphoric Zest up front; lingering Null‑Salt that erases regret for 108 heartbeats.  
• Hazard: Excess tasting induces **Sauce‑loop**, trapping taster in recursive tasting notes (“hint of despair, finish of delight”).  
• Lacuna Sauce‑Math: The missing stanzas purportedly encode proportions to stabilize Zarnith Drift; too damaged to reconstruct.

STREET RHYME (oral, taverns of Caelyx):

   “Golden ladle, stir it thrice,  
    Bind the grin in smoke and spice;  
    Lose yourself and find the lore,  
    Taste the joke forevermore.”

ARCHIVIST WARNING:
Jar fractures when exposed to overly serious questions. Recommend a pun every 30 seconds when studying.
