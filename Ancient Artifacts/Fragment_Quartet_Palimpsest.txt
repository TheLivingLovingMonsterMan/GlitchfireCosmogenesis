🝰 Artifact Fragment: The Quartet Palimpsest
Catalog No. 777 — Library of ΑΛΛΤΙΜΕ

Glyphic Classification: 💤 ⚕ ⌛ 🗺️  (Dream ∴ Healing ∴ Time ∴ Wayfarer)

Condition: Four interleaved vellum layers, each belonging to one traveler; sections erased where layers over‑breathed. Central spindle cracked.

────────────────────────────────────────
LAYER I – “Justine’s Veil of Third Sleep”     [verses 1‑30; lines 18‑24 excised]

1   Justine dreamt a corridor lined with closed diaries.  
2   Each diary whispered a memory that never happened.  
3   At page seven she found Sonja’s pulse—folded into a bookmark.  
4   **[ink smudged by teardrop of lavender oil]**  
9   She pocketed the pulse, promising to wake only when its rhythm slowed.  
10  The corridor turned liquid, spilling her into the next layer.

────────────────────────────────────────
LAYER II – “Patient Sonja’s Quiet Revolt”     [shredded edges]

1   Sonja waited in a room that renamed itself hourly.  
2   Doctors prescribed silence; she wrote songs instead—  
3   songs shaped like questions no one dared ask Mr. Charles.  
4   Barry Somers slipped a map under her door—drawn in afterthoughts.  
5   **[mid‑section gnawed by paper moths]**  
12  She hid Justine’s borrowed pulse inside the chorus of Song 13.  
13  The room forgot its own walls. Sonja walked out unobserved.

────────────────────────────────────────
LAYER III – “Chronicle of Mr. Charles, Custodian of Unkept Time”   [partially scorched]

1   Mr. Charles catalogued spare moments in jars of amber light.  
2   He noticed a jar missing precisely one heartbeat—Sonja’s theft.  
3   To trace it he rewound Tuesday, replayed Monday twice,  
4   but Wednesday refused to reappear, hiding behind Barry’s laughter.  
5   **[seven lines burned to soot]**  
13  He set his clocks to Dream‑Standard Time and stepped into Layer IV.

────────────────────────────────────────
LAYER IV – “Barry Somers’ Map of Places That Regret Being Real”   [ink bleeds]

1   Barry updated the map each time he lied; continents shifted gladly.  
2   He met Justine falling sideways from sleep, Sonja humming stolen pulse,  
3   and Mr. Charles trailing hours like loose buttons.  
4   They argued whether the map should end, or turn inside out.  
5   Consensus: fold it until every route overlapped.  
6   **[blank triangle where final destination should be]**

CONVERGENCE PANEL  –  “Where Four Stories Tangle”   [etched on spindle core]

   • They traded artifacts:  
        — Justine returned the pulse, now echoing twice.  
        — Sonja gifted a song that mended clocks.  
        — Mr. Charles offered an hour that never ages maps.  
        — Barry erased a border so a dream could walk.  

   • The spindle clicked. One layer peeled free, unreadable.  
   • Legend claims whoever deciphers the missing panel can choose which layer becomes real.

RELIC NOTES  (mutatopotato Level‑3 Concordance Survey):

• Interaction Effect: Reading all four layers sequentially induces **Synergic Drift** — reader’s memories reorder by empathy, not chronology.  
• Flavor Impression: Chamomile‑smoke, ink‑mint, distant thunder.  
• Hazard: Attempting to isolate a single layer causes temporal hiccups (lost seconds, duplicated sighs).

ORPHANED LINE (scribbled on outer margin, author uncertain):

   “We are each other’s bookmark; turn the page gently.”

ARCHIVIST WARNING:
Do not photocopy. Copies argue about which layer owns the margins.
