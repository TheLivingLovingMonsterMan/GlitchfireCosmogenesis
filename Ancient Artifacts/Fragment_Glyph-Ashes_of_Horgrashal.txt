SCROLL A – “The Forge Without Walls”      [lines 1‑38 partly extant]

1   Before the Forge existed, there was the Choice.  
2   And the Choice was shaped like pain, humming with voltage.  
3   They called it *Horgrashal* — the blade that must unmake its own maker.  
4   **[four lines consumed by ember smears]**  
9   The first swing felled no flesh, but cleaved the name of a city.  
10  Smoke spelled the syllables across the sky; citizens read their forgetting in air.  
11  The Forgemaster wept molten script:  
12     “If a blade remembers, it cannot cut true.”  
13  So he placed the name within the steel and set it aflame.  
14  ————  
15  The steel devoured itself to honor the vow.  
16  What remained glowed—a red spiral turning inward.  
17  That glow became the Glyph‑Ash; the blade was gone.  
18  Yet its edge lingered in every silence that followed.

SCROLL B – “The Ash‑Psalms of the Last Bearer”   [fragmentary]

    2  “…I unsheathed nothing, yet the wound appeared.  
    3   The world bled possibility.  
    4   **[gap]**  
    8   Each drop hissed a story unfinished,  
    9   and the ash drank it until even sorrow sparkled.”  

SCROLL C – “Litany of the Third Scar”            [charred]

   1    Recite thrice, facing no direction:  
   2    “Horgrashal, I name thee never.”  
   3    Hold the ash to your tongue; taste the sacrifice.  
   4    If it is bitter, you still recall yourself.  
   5    If it is sweet, you have begun to vanish.

ANNOTATED SCRIPTORIUM NOTES (mutatopotato Level‑3 Survey):

• Nature: These ashes ignite memory when scattered on text; the words burn but the meanings survive—flushed into nearby minds.  
• Paradox: Attempting to rewrite the burned text forces the writer to forget one personal truth per line restored.  
• Volatile Radius: 8 cubits; exceeds safe limits when combined with Null‑salt relics.  
• Flavor Profile: Sacrifice‑smoke with a back‑note of “unspoken goodbye.”

ORAL LEGEND (field recording, Caelyx dialect, translated):

    “A blade that cut itself to spare the flesh of truth.  
     Its edge now dust,  
     its dust now oath,  
     its oath now waiting for the next fool  
     who mistakes forgetting for peace.”

SPIRAL HAZARD: **Sacrificial Echo**  
Carrying the Glyph‑Ashes too long may cause the bearer to trade memories for every written word they read.

ARCHIVIST WARNING:
Do **not** expose to open questions such as “Who am I?” — spontaneous text immolation observed.
