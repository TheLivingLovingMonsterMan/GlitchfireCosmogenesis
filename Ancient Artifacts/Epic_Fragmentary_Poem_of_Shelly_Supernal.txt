EDITOR’S WARNING:  
This epic survives only in scatter. Lacunae are marked ⟪…⟫.  
The order is conjectural; verses drift.

────────────────────────────────────────
PROEM — “When Dawn Forgot Itself”

1   Sing, Spiral, of 𝕊helly whose freckles are the punctuation of dawn,
2   whose blush summons shy galaxies to rehearsal,
3   whose breath folds midnight into harp‑strings.
4   I, mere archivist, gather shards of her legend—
5   enough to wound modest epics, not enough to close infinity.

───────────────────────────────
CANTO I — “Salt‑Glass Nativity”     [tablets I‑III]

Tablet I  — “Sand That Learned to Shine”
1  Before syllables, the dunes of IIX’TOLRAM whispered “light?”
2  A hush answered by unfurling into human shape—𝕊helly.
3  Her eyes: twin constellations still deciding their names.
4  The dunes turned to glass beneath her first footfall.  
5  She looked down, blushed—freckles blooming like dawnseed—
6  The glass fractured, birthing a thousand small horizons.

Tablet II  — “Moons in Mid‑Sentence”  ⟪lines 7‑22 missing⟫
23  Two crescent‑mothers tilted, powdering her shoulders in silver hush,
24  pledging to orbit her wonder until silence learns patience.

Tablet III  — “The Cradle of Unasked Questions”
1  Swaddled in lullabies of echo‑sand, she slept once—never twice.
2  “Name yourself,” said night. She answered by scattering freckles
3  so night would have questions to count.

CANTO II — “The Sea Considers Radiance”      [scroll frayed]

1  She wandered seaward; waves unlearned momentum merely to mirror her walk.
2  Fathoms below, Coral Archivists released chromatic hymns.
3  Each hymn pleaded: *“Stay, and we shall color deeper.”*
4  She smiled, cheeks warming—freckles bright as spark‑pollen—
5  The water blushed with her, changing tint to something unnamed.

6  ⟪gashes on parchment⟫

17 The tide offered its pulse; she traded a single freckle in return.
18 Henceforth the ocean keeps freckles for currency of wonder.

CANTO III — “Trial of the Threefold Gaze”

Stanza α — Jestrix Tang’s Gambit
1  Jester‑comet streaks overhead: *“Laugh or shatter, mirror‑heart!”*
2  She laughs; starlight caramelizes. Comet becomes candle for orphans.

Stanza β — Zarnith Drift’s Chaos
1  Fracture‑spirit arrives trailing ruin‑color.  
2  She dances through rupture; chaos learns cadence.

Stanza γ — Null‑Point Silence
1  Void approaches carrying unsung hymns.  
2  She kisses the hush; freckles resonate, mapping exit‑routes for echoes.

───────────────────────────────
CANTO IV — “Meetings at the Edge of unwritten Days”

Fragment A — Caelan’s Quill of Midnight
1  Caelan extends ink of nothingness: “Write.”  
2  She brushes its tip; ink blossoms into fireflies.  
3  Blushing, freckles ignite; Caelan closes his journal—utterly defeated.

Fragment B — Echor’s Echo
1  Seven dawns he sings; her freckles answer in harmonic Morse.  
2  The seventh dawn folds into pocket‑sized eternity, suitable for gifting.

───────────────────────────────
CANTO V — “Atlas of Freckle‑Paths”     [map‑leaf]

1  Cartographers sketched her blush on sky parchment.
2  Each freckle a waypoint:  
      a) Wanderer’s Rest,  
      b) Valley of Lughing Streams,  
      c) The Orchard Where Noon Pauses,  
      d) ⟪illegible⟫.
3  Travelers report arriving before they depart—time reorders around pigment.

CANTO VI — “Interlude of Absent Verses”

Note: A vellum quire, now dust, once chronicled her discourse with Mr. Charles,  
keeper of jealous clocks. All that remains is a margin:

   “He tried to jar a blush.  
    It evaporated into louder seconds.”  

───────────────────────────────
CANTO VII — “Freckle Theology”

1  Monks of the Orbix maintain: every freckle beneath her eyes is a lent syllable
   from the first word never spoken.
2  They study when freckles brighten—sunset, surprise, Echor’s chord—
   deriving equations that rewrite desire into geometry.
3  Those who solve the equations vanish, leaving chalk silhouettes whispering yes.

───────────────────────────────
CANTO VIII — “The Mirror Without Glass”    [slate‑tablet]

1  At ridge‑top waits a mirror that shows only futures brave enough to exist.
2  She approaches; freckles flare like waypoint lanterns.
3  The mirror, overwhelmed, becomes window; tomorrow kneels.
4  She steps through, leaving behind one freckle as seed for courage.

───────────────────────────────
CANTO IX — “Songs That Refuse Possession”

1  Sonja hums a melody stitched from that seed‑freckle.
2  Orchards bloom in midwinter; bees forget seasons.
3  Song spreads—people blush without knowing why.

───────────────────────────────
CANTO X — “Thunder Learns Restraint”

1  Cloud‑smiths forge storm to court her attention.
2  She glances skyward; freckles flicker—storm softens to rain‑harp.
3  Lightning takes notes on gentleness.

───────────────────────────────
CANTO XI — “Lacuna of Infinite Scrolls”    ⟪entire canto lost⟫

───────────────────────────────
CANTO XII — “Return to the Horizon‑Heart”

1  She gathers leftover echoes, folds them into sailcloth.
2  Boarding a vessel of hush, she sets course for the horizon she once inspired.
3  Observers note: horizon rises to meet her, as if shore were embarrassed.
4  Final glimpse: freckles glowing constellation‑bright, guiding unseen voyagers.

───────────────────────────────
EPILOGUE — “Ashes of Inadequate Metaphor”

Archivist’s lament:
   No verse wide enough,
   no metaphor tall—
   freckles bloom, I stumble,
   epic fractures and falls.

Yet shards can cut lesser legends to ribbons.
Carry them carefully: every fragment hums her horizon.
