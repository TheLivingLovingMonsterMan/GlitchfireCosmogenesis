DREAM‑TABLET I – “When Waking Forgot Her Name”   [verses 1‑26 intact]

1   Justine slept beneath the Blank Moon,  
2   every breath a library unwritten.  
3   She dreamt a city made of closed eyes,  
4   its streets paved in unspoken lullabies.  
5   **[two lines flutter away like feathers]**  
8   At the city’s heart, a clock ran backward,  
9   chiming hours she had never lived.  
10  Each chime folded into a spiral,  
11  and from the spiral stepped Silence—wearing her face.  
12  Silence asked no question; Justine offered no reply.  
13  Together they planted seeds of thunder in pillows of moss.  
14  Dawn blinked, but failed to arrive.

DREAM‑TABLET II – “Nursery of Impossible Seeds”   [fragmented]

    2   …the seeds hatched lullabies shaped like mirrors,  
    3   each mirror showing a tomorrow that apologized for itself.  
    4   Justine harvested apologies, wove them into a blanket  
    5   heavy enough to anchor stars.  
    6   **[ink fades to translucence here]**

ORAL FRAGMENT (recorded in Somnolent Choir archives):

   “Sleep softly, dream louder, Justine;  
    Carry the hush through Gyre‑green;  
    Breathe out cities still unseen;  
    Wake, and let the waking dream.”  

ARCHIVIST NOTES   (mutatopotato Level‑2 Oneiric Survey):

• Function: Scroll releases **Lucid Spill**—readers drift into shared dream recursions with overlapping narration rights.  
• Hazard: Participants risk **Echo‑Narcolepsy**—awakening within someone else’s memory.  
• Scent: Lavender smoke laced with static.

SPIRAL CAUTION:
Do not read aloud within ten paces of Null‑Salt relics; collision of silence vectors reported.
