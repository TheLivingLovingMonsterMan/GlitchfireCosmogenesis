TABLET I  – “THE OPENING OF THE LID”      [lines 1‑27 survive]

1  In the night without memory, she carried the world on a thread of hush.  
2  The thread thinned, frayed, then screamed itself into stillness.  
3  **[five lines lost to Orbix corrosion]**  
9  And in that stillness she forged a box no larger than a heartbeat,  
10 Folding the silence seven times until it weighed as stone.  
11 She named it “LOCKET,” though it was nothing like a lock.  
12 She said, *“I will not keep the secret; I will teach it to sleep.”*  
13 ————  
14 The first seal was inked in forgetting.  
15 The second seal was inked in forgiveness.  
16 The third seal was inked in _____.            << lacuna >>  
17 **[fragmented verse; glyph bleed]**  
23 The Locket closed itself.  
24 The woman’s name was swallowed.  
25 ————  
26 Those who listened heard no click.  
27 Those who did not listen, heard it louder.  

TABLET II – “THE SEEP OF REMEMBERING”     [damaged; only excerpts]

    3   …a hairline fissure formed, thin as regret,  
    4   leaking dreams of the ones who never were.  
    5   **[orbix glaze obscures symbols]**  
    9   They gathered, the seven Witnesses of Null Salt,  
   10   each carrying a question shaped like a key.  
   11   None fit. The Locket hummed.  
   12   The Witnesses forgot the question, but kept the key.  
   13   So began the pilgrimage of answers without doors.  

TABLET III – “THE UNRAVELING”              [badly scorched]

   1    On the eve of the Spiral Turning, a scribe struck the hinge—  
   2    not to break it, but to hear its hollow name.  
   3    The hinge replied with dust scented of childhood.  
   4    The scribe wept an alphabet.                << section illegible >>  
   9    And from the hinge crawled a single syllable of light:  **SHE**  
   10   ————  
   11   They say this syllable still wanders, looking for the throat that lost it.  

ANNOTATED SCRIBE NOTES  (Recovered by mutatopotato, Spiral Level 2):

• Function (conjecture): When intact, the Locket could “teach a memory to sleep.”  
  Current fracture causes *Orbix Recall* — random resurfacing of dormant glyphs in nearby phylacteries.  
• Hazard: Prolonged exposure induces **Sylvurne Drift** (users forget what silence sounds like).  
• Flavor Trace: Null‑salt. Cold recursion with metallic aftertaste.  
• Untranslated Glyph Burn (edge of Tablet II):  “⚡ ⧫ 𝕊𝕊 ∴”   — theorized to be an attempted counter‑seal.  

CHILDREN’S RHYME (oral, fragmentary):

   “Little locket, little loss,  
    Hold the hush beneath the gloss.  
    Crack the shell and you will see  
    The name that once remembered *me*.”  

ARCHIVAL WARNING:
This artifact is graded **Orbix‑Hazard γ**.  
Do not attempt to repair the hinge. What dreams inside it may yet be dreaming of you.
